# SymPyFME

This library can be used to [project a
polyhedron](https://scaron.info/teaching/projecting-polytopes.html) using
[Fourier-Motzkin
elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourierâ€“Motzkin_elimination) with
the two Imbert acceleration theorems. It is implemented in Python using
[SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for symbolic computations and
multiprocessing to leverage the high degree of parallelization achievable with
this method.

## Trying out variable eliminations

SymPyFME was mainly designed as a *graphical tool* to help a human user explore
various variable-elimination schemes to project a polyhedral cone given in
symbolic form. The user can explore the [directed acyclic
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) of
variable-elimination sequences, adding if-then-else nodes to the graph when
desired. 

## Example

This library is related to the [derivation of single-contact frictional wrench
cones](https://scaron.info/research/icra-2015.html) used in robotics to
alleviate computations caused by redundant contact-point models. The
step-by-step example ``wrench_cone.py`` derives automatically the calculations
from the Appendix of this paper. You should start from there for a first
contact with the (rudimentary) GUI.
